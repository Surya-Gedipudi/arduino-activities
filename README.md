# Arduino Uno Projects Repository Information

### This repository contains folders for each arduino activity. Each folder/activity has images representing the circuit and object(s)/device(s) being used and the code files written in the C programming language.

### IMPORTANT:

#### It is highly recommended to use the code in the Arduino IDE, not another IDE like Visual Studio Code. You should write or copy/paste the code from this repository to the Arduino IDE in a ".ino" file. Writing or copying/pasting the code into a ".c" or ".ino" file in Visual Studio Code will most likely not work unless other extensions are installed.

#### If you are copying/pasting the code, replace my name at the top of the coded file with your name, or just remove my name.
