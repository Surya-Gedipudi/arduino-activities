#### Unfortunately, I lost my original code file for this project. Here are some instructions to help you write the code. It is a good idea to use the Temperature Sensor project code and materials (with an RGB LED) for this Temperature Sensor + RGB LED project:

- All temperatures are measured in Celsius
- The current temperature should be displayed in Celsius and Fahrenheit in the serial monitor
- The RGB LEDs should illuminate based on the following criteria:
  - Fahrenheit >= 75 ----> RED = HIGH (all others LOW)
  - 73 <= Fahrenheit < 75 ----> BLUE = HIGH (all others LOW)
  - 70 <= Fahrenheit < 73 ----> GREEN = HIGH (all others LOW)
  - Fahrenheit < 70 ----> all LEDs LOW (off)
